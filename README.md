# Homework 1

This homework assignment covers the content that we discussed in class up until and including February 5.

hello
## GitHub

We will exlusively use GitHub for all assignments in this class. Therefore (and because it is broadly used in industry), you should familiarize yourself with GitHub and its features.

### 1. Learn about GitHub

Perform this "Hello World" exercise: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/


### 2. Understand Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a language for simple text formatting. Usually, markdown files end in `.md` (like this file, `README.md`).

You will complete this homework assignment by modifying this Markdown file (`README.md`).

Take a look at these resources to understand Markdown basics:

* https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/
* https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
* https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet


### 3. Modify README

Read about the `README.md` file: https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/

Now, edit the `README.md` file in this homework repository by clicking the `README.md` file in the list of files:

![README file](images/readme.png)

Then click the pencil icon to edit it:

![Edit button](./images/edit.png)

Next, edit this line to add your name: **Your Name**

Click the "Preview changes" tab to see your changes.

When you are happy with your changes, click the "Commit changes" button at the bottom (optionally entering a commit title and description):

![Commit](./images/commit.png)

You should now see your name above (instead of "Your Name"). You can also see your change in the repository's commit history.


### 4. LinkedIn profile URL

[LinkedIn](linkedin.com) is a professional networking site used by almost all companies and recruiters. By establishing your professional profile now, to can begin to connect with other classmates and build your professional network.

Please sign up for LinkedIn and share your LinkedIn profile URL here. If you do not wish to be a member of LinkedIn, please write "I decline.":

[My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/.../)


### 5. Setup GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a feature of GitHub that lets you serve webpages directly from a GitHub repository.

You will need to do this once for each homework assignment and class project.

Click the "Settings" tab in your repository:

![Settings tab](./images/settings.png)

Enable GitHub Pages on the master branch:

![GitHub Pages](./images/gh-pages.png)

After saving, note the public URL of your repository -- you will use this in the "Writing Code" section below:

![GitHub Pages URL](./images/gh-pages-url.png)

### 9. HTTPS

What does the S stand for in HTTPS?
: Secure


Why is HTTPS better than HTTP?
: HTTPS is better than HTTP because, HTTPS is the safest and more secure web experience for the users.It protects the user information and   also prevents from cyber attacks. The drawback of HTTP is that the data isn't encrypted.Hackers can easily hijack the connection,because  they can see what the browser is requesting and the site is sending.They can intercept the data sent by the site and alter it before      sending it on the browser. Without HTTPS any data passed is insecure. 





Should all web pages use HTTPS?
: Yes because, In HTTPS the data is encrypted which helps in maintaining the security. We all want to exchange our private information  securely so that the unauthorized access is prevented.HTTPS helps to keep the website secure.
